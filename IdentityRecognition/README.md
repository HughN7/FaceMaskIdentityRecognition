# Preliminary upload todo:

detection ipynb needs to be converted for website as a regular .py file. 
training ipynb is only for reference. Direct to google colab for training. 
Current upload doesn't represent full capabilities. 

- Detection is not complete. Currently debating on whether to split training into two separate models so that we can train with two colab sessions instead of one = parallel training for shorter time.
